# Welcome to the validators race!
![welcome-story-validators-race](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc7e324f-b66b-493d-92ae-11ff30dbba30)

This is a unique opportunity to complete a series of tasks and receive test tokens. The race is designed for validators looking to make useful contributions to the Story blockchain network.

## Purpose of the Race

The main goal of the race is to distribute test tokens to validators who actively participate in the network and make meaningful contributions to the project.

## Conditions of Participation
To start the race, you need to complete the first task. After its successful completion and approval via pull request, you will be able to move on to the next stage. Important: the tasks must be completed sequentially. The next step will only be available after the previous step is completed.

> Please note that the STAKEME team may reject your PR if they believe you are a multi-accuser or have not completed the tasks properly. The first task is not subject to appeal.

## Tasks

### [Task 1: Introduce yourself](./tasks/task1/README.md)
The first step requires you to introduce yourself and your activities as a validator. Your submission should include:
- Information about your validator.
- The networks in which you validate.
- Recent contributions you have made to blockchain projects.
Once your application is approved, you can move on to the second task.

### [Task 2: Launch Archived Node](./tasks/task2/README.md)
In this task, you will have to install and launch an archive node in Iliad Testnet. This will demonstrate your skills in deploying the node.

### [Task 3: Provide public endpoints of the archive node](./tasks/task3/README.md)
After successfully launching the archive node, you will need to provision public endpoints so that other users can interact with your node, starting from the first block.

### Task 4: Launching the Validator Node
In the last step, you must prepare and launch a validator node. This will prove that your node is ready to perform the validation function and keep the network running.
