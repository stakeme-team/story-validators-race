## Disclaimer
> The Story Validator Race is organized by the Stekeme team with the support of the Story team. Participation in this contest does not guarantee entry into the mainnet or any airdrop. The race is designed as an opportunity for validators to earn test tokens and demonstrate their skills. Our goal is to give validators a platform to showcase their abilities and connect with the community, while mitigating the risk of multi-account participation. For the Story team, this contest is a valuable opportunity to compile a list of experienced validators, though any further actions with this list are at the discretion of the Story team.

## Purpose of the Race
The main goal of the race is to distribute test tokens to validators who actively participate in the network and make meaningful contributions to the project.

## Conditions of participation in wave-2
To start the race, you can start by doing any task you want. Read carefully the terms and conditions for submitting a particular task. If you have any questions about the your application or specifically the task, you can ask us a question in Story discord (#validator-support)

‼️ Important! Before you start doing tasks, create a data.json file at the path `wave-2/submissions/validator_moniker/data.json`, where `validator_moniker` is the name of your validator.</br>
</br>
`validator_address` - your validator address (valoper)</br>
`discord_id` - your discord id</br>
`discord_username` - your discord username</br>
In `data.json`, fill in the contents:
```
{
  "validator_address": "string",

After that, create a PR with the name: `Information file <validator_moniker>`
