Hello, 
My name is Huy Vo, and I am an experienced validator with a deep commitment to supporting and contributing to decentralized networks. I have been actively involved in the blockchain ecosystem for several years and have a strong track record of running validator and full nodes across various networks.

Currently, I am running a Story Full Node and Story Validator node with the following credentials:

Validator Address: storyvaloper1my35enrnxys9jl77xrp3slla3780fndzjqgu73
Validator Public Key (Base64): AnjyU4/2uhflOLAxNmBGmiquqB7NtwSq8Uwa2zCHIs8O

My experience spans a wide range of blockchain projects. Previously, I have successfully operated nodes for the following projects:

SUI
Aleo
Aptos
MUON
Celestia
Subspace
ChainFlip

In addition to these, I am currently contributing to the following projects as a node operator:

Zero Gravity 0G (https://testnet.0g.explorers.guru/validator/0gvaloper1n6trjm7qrfzdt340p35uvrms3ejumvkpp9a0u3)

As a dedicated validator, I consistently ensure optimal performance, security, and uptime for all the nodes I manage. My experience with both full and validator nodes allows me to troubleshoot effectively and implement best practices in node management. I have a proactive approach to maintaining network health and frequently engage with project communities to offer feedback, participate in testing phases, and assist in stress testing new features.

I am passionate about contributing to the growth and stability of decentralized networks, and I am confident that my extensive experience in node operations and validator management makes me well-suited to support the Story Protocol. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to this exciting project as a validator.
