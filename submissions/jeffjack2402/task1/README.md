**Information about my validator**<br>
My name is Jack, i am independent POS validator and blockchain enthusiast. I have 5 years experience as a fullstack web developer, so I have a lot of knowledge about website and learn a lot about blockchain. On my servers, I ran many node operators and validators on Cosmos chain like as: quicksilver, sei, haqq, dymension, ... or I ran obol and ssv testnet too; I wrote bots to monitoring validator's status or performance. Because I always keep my node very well.
