# **Introduce Yourself:**

Hello,

I am a 24-year-old computer engineer with over 8 years of experience in the cryptocurrency space. I began my journey by participating in platform testnets for emerging projects, eventually transitioning to running node testnets. Throughout this process, I have maintained high uptime rates and stability, always striving to maximize the security and efficiency of the networks I contribute to.

As someone well-versed in the dynamics of the crypto market, I consider myself highly experienced in the field of validation and continue to offer my expertise to the best of my ability.
