## Operated networks
Currently running or having run validators for several networks including : 0G, Babylon, Initia, various EigenLayer operators, Juneo, Elixir, HyperLiquid, ...

## Experience
As a devops in multiple projects, I'm used to deploy and maintain large node infrastructures while handling problem-solving that can occur and aiming at maximum uptime and availability for services (validation, RPC, ...).
Several security measures are systematically deployed on servers like changing default ports for remote access, denying all unneeded ports, using strict whitelists, proxies and VPN.
I'm used to deploy with multiple server providers, from VPS to bare metal depending on the needs.
I also promote and run some node in the south hemisphere to encourage decentralization when appropriate/asked.
