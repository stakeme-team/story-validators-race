> ITRocket provide services for projects, developers and  validators, custom monitoring and analysis tools to enhance community effectiveness and network reliability. Our services also include but are not limited to: Daily snapshots, state-sync, public endpoints, peering and seed-node services, RPC Scanner, Decentralization Analytics, Proposal Bot, Peer scanner, and more.
Our rapidly growing user base, which has increased by 1.6 times (from 15,000 to 25,000 unique daily users on our website in the last two months) and an average of 20 million requests to our public endpoints are a testament to our reliability and the community's trust in our services.  

### Networks in which we operate as validators
We are core validators in projects like Celestia, Zetachain, Initia and many others. Most of the links to our validators in the active set are available on our website: https://itrocket.net/delegate/

Below is a list of networks not yet featured on our site, but where we are active as validator or contributor: Autonity R6 genesis validator, Webb, Taiko

## Our Services
https://itrocket.net/services</br>
We actively engage and contribute to every project we participate in, providing with services, guides, scripts and helping with any emerging issues.
- RPC scanner including RAW results (updates every 4h)
- Peers Scanner (with real time uptime verification)
- Public Endpoints: RPC, API, JSON RPC, gRPC
- Snapshot, Statesync
- Installation Guide
- Peer, Seed, Live peers
- Decentralization Analytics
- Governance Bot, Explorer

## Governance Bot  
  https://t.me/itrocket_mainnet_proposal_bot  
  https://t.me/itrocket_testnet_proposal_bot
  
- *New Proposals Alerts:* Get notified whenever new governance proposals are submitted.
- *Upgrade Reminders:* Receive alerts about upcoming software upgrades.
- *Vote Results Notifications:* Track the results of governance votes with timely updates.
- *Customizable Alerts:* Tailor your notification settings to fit your preferences.

## RPC Scanner
https://itrocket.net/services/testnet/story/public-rpc/</br>

- Network RPC Discovery: Automatically finds all RPC nodes within the network.
- Archival Node Check: Verifies whether each RPC node is archival or not.
- Binary Version Check: Ensures the node is running the correct binary version.
- Validator Node Check: Identifies whether the node is a validator.
- Raw Data Access: Provides data in raw format for further development.


## Peers Scanner

- Active Peer Discovery: Finds and lists only active peers.
- Uptime Check: real-time peer uptime verification.
- Best Peer Filtering: Shows only the most reliable peers.
- Customizable Criteria: Allows modifications to parameters for peer selection.

> Stale peers can lead to node inefficiency over time. Our network scanner verifies active peers for decent uptime in real-time.

## Decentralization Analytics
https://itrocket.net/services/mainnet/celestia/decentralization/</br>

As part of the analytics we provide:
- Decentralization map
- Decentralization indexes by regions, countries, and hosting providers
- Voting power distribution index

> Analytics is provided for different types of nodes: all nodes, RPC nodes, and validator nodes.
