My validator is OranG3cluB, and I've been deeply involved in the Cosmos ecosystem for some time. What sets me apart is that I'm a solo validator. 
No big team behind me, just a strong commitment to each project I work with. Once I join a project, I'm in it for the long run. This dedication is something I'm eager to bring to Story Protocol
