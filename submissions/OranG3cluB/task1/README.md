My validator is OranG3cluB, and I've been deeply involved in the Cosmos ecosystem for some time. What sets me apart is that I'm a solo validator. 
No big team behind me, just a strong commitment to each project I work with. Once I join a project, I'm in it for the long run. This dedication is something I'm eager to bring to Story Protocol. Here's a quick rundown of some of the projects I'm currently involved in as a validator:

I'm focused on the technical side of validating. In all projects, my uptime is 100%. I'm always available when it's time to update the node, even in emergencies, because I have all the necessary alerts set up. I'm also actively involved in project governance. So, maintaining the validator's operations successfully is my most significant contribution.
