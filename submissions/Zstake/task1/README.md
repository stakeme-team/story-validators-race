 > Zstake Trusted Proof-of-Stake validator & Tendermint chain service provider. Since 2018, I have participated as an advisor for several DeFi projects and a developer for a Korean cryptocurrency exchange. I started running Zstake in 2004 with the idea of ​​focusing my passion on one project rather than participating in many projects. 
Although it hasn't been long since we started, we were able to get the honor of being ranked first in the validator selection for some projects. Based on this experience, I will do my best as a validator at Story Protocol.
