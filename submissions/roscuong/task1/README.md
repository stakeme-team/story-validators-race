# **About me:**

My name is Cuong. I am a professional and independent POS validator and blockchain enthusiast. 
I am still learning but have completed more than 5 projects with uptime >99%. And because I am in the process of improving my skills, I can be online 24/7 to update new technologies as well as handle problems immediately when needed. I am using server services from large companies based in Germany and Finland. So all my validators always have good uptime.
