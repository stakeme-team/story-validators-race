## Introduction
ZULNA is not just validators, we're like friendly guides. Located in the beautiful landscape of Indonesia, we're ready to show you how we work, introduce our amazing team, and share our history of doing things really well in the blockchain world. Our primary goal is to empower you with the essential tools and knowledge needed for seamless node operations.

Although we're relatively new in this field, we have over 2+ years of experience and served less than 2,000 delegators. Our commitment is to foster trust and consistency. Ensuring uptime is our priority, using dedicated servers globally, backed by multiple 24/7 alert systems and supported remote signing solutions. While performing validations across more than 35+ PoS networks, our main focus is to provide a reliable service.



## Services
We offer public goods and build tools for delegators, validators and developers. These tools include validator performance analytics, daily full/pruned snapshots, state-sync, peering services, RPC/REST endpoints and more.<br> Explore all our technical contributions at https://service.zulnaaa.com/
