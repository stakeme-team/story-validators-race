## About Me 🙋‍♂️

Hello, my name is RogerRabbit from Thailand. I have a passion for running nodes and studying various code related to Web3, as well as troubleshooting issues. I’ve been running a node since 2022 and have gained experience from numerous other projects. I enjoy educating people about node operation on X and YouTube.
