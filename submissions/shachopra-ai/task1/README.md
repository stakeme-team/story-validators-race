Hello, I am Shaurya.

I am Civil Engineer by profession and have started running nodes this year.

Currently I am ACTIVE validator for zero-gravity testnet and Empeiria Testnet.

I am running all nodes of zero gravity project like storage node, storage kv node & DA node. 

Previously I ran initia inactive testnet node.

I am running story geth node and story illiad testnet node starting from block 0 and transaction index ON. I am hoping to become active validator for story testnet.

My future plan is to provide explorer, faucet and snapshot services for blockchain projects. 
. 
I am interested in testing new features & want to have early access to new features, like to experiment with upcoming protocol, looking for valuable learning experience, like to engage with community of developers & validators who actively contribute to blockchain project.
I am well versed with linux command line operation. Good understanding of validating Cosmos blockchain protocol. Understanding of networking concepts like TCP/IP, ports, and network protocols (HTTP, WebSocket). Familiarity with tools for monitoring validator performance like block height, validator uptime, etc.
