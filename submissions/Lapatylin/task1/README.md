My validator Story: (https://testnet.storyscan.app/validators/storyvaloper12clnw7e7tqxtxrk9ju89txpwr99dr6cwph9qhq

Hello, my name is Oleksii, and I'm a dedicated validator from Ukraine with a passion for cryptocurrencies, particularly since 2021.

I currently validate main networks such as Arkhadian, BlockX, Forta, Humanode, Massa, Minima, Muon, Nibiru. Additionally, I have actively participated in and continue to support numerous test networks, including projects like Aleo, Allora, Aptos, Autonity, Bevm, Bundlr, Elixir, Fleek, Fuel, Goracle, Holograph, IO.net, Lumoz (Opside), Masa Finance, Obol, Penumbra, SUI, Shardeum, StarkNet, Taiko, Taraxa, Vistara, Ziesha (Zeeka).

My expertise further extends to validating networks based on Cosmos SDK, encompassing projects like Althea, Archway, Arkeo, Artela, Cascadia, Celestia, Composable, Empeiria, Entangle, Fiamma, Galactica, Gnoland, Haqq, Humans, Initia, Kyve, Lava, Mande, Mantra, Mars, Namada (Anoma), Noria, Paloma, Pryzm, Quasar, Quicksilver, Sei, Side, Stride, SHDW, Temporal, Teritory, Warden, 0G. I am well-versed in testing networks built on Substrate, including 5ire, Avail, ChainFlip, Gear, Pontem, Subspace and T3rn.

In my validation endeavors, I leverage leased host providers such as Hetzner, OVH, DigitalOcean, Contabo, among others. Ensuring server security is a top priority, I implement tools like File2Ban and SSH keys. To monitor hardware health effectively, I employ Node exporter, Prometheus Server, Grafana, TenderDuty and Telegram bots, with ongoing exploration into Zabbix for further enhancement.

My uptime is 99%:

In addition to my validator role, I possess substantial experience with ambassador programs, proudly serving as an ambassador for Nibiru, SupraOracles, REBL (Yuser), and Unique Network. As an ambassador, my primary focus is to amplify the project's reach, and I currently engage with a thriving community of over 1500 followers on Twitter.

Installation, configuration of validators, mining. I try to participate in all testnets. All my validators are updated on time, have good uptime. I vote in proposals. I help newbies with technical issues.
