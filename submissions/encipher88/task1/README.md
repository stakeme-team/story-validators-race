# **About me:**
Im individual validator who have a part in Systemd group (group of independent validators)

In terms of my experience, I have been actively involved in the blockchain space, particularly in smart contract development and infrastructure exploration. I have successfully completed the Zero2Hero courses on smart contract development, achieving excellent marks in the exams. You can find evidence of my achievements on platforms like OpenSea, where I have a verified record of completing the courses  https://opensea.io/assets/bsc/0xadc466855ebe8d1402c5f7e6706fccc3aedb44a0/6534516

One notable experience is my mainnet delegation on NEAR, where I am a validator with encipher.poolv1.near. You can find more information about my validator status and performance on NEAR at https://nearscope.net/validator/encipher.poolv1.near/tab/dashboard.

Furthermore, I have explored and engaged with multiple other blockchain projects and ecosystems. Some of the notable ones include Everscale, Aleo, Archway, Humanode, Kyve, Stratos, Quicksilver, Teritori, Massa, Cosmic Horizon, Stafihub, Subspace, Deweb, Kira, Sei, Masa Finance, Ironfish, Sui, NEAR Stakewars-III, Starknet, Bifrost, Neutron, Namada, and Stader. By actively participating in these projects and testnets, I have gained a wide range of experiences and insights into different blockchain technologies, ecosystems, and their associated tools and protocols.

Recently I took the top 10 place in a paid testnet from Namada with 100%uptime, in which the most famous teams of noders competed.

Moreover, I have invested time and effort in building infrastructure, including explorers, APIs, RPC, scripts, and Grafana dashboards. Which u can find in my github  encipher88 . This demonstrates my dedication to not only utilizing blockchain technologies but also contributing to their development and enhancement. By building and maintaining these infrastructure components, I aim to provide useful resources and tools for the broader blockchain community.

Overall, my experiences in smart contract development, participation in testnets, exploration of various blockchain projects, and contribution to infrastructure development highlight my commitment to continuous learning, practical application, and active engagement in the blockchain ecosystem.
