Hello, My name is Sagorahmed. I began my crypto journey in 2017, but I started feeling interesting about running nodes a year ago. I really like to participate in the early stages (testnet) of some amazing projects and try to give feedback and suggestions about any unexpected things I face on that network. I believe it helps them to improve the stability and performance of the network for the next phase of that project.
Validator nodes are the most important aspect of a true dicentralized blockchain network. I feel really proud when my validator node validates and secures each block of the network.

Here are some of my node info:
1. Farcaster (Testnet):
http://198.7.121.37:3000/d/af04c037-bd8f-484a-b93e-0cb4b7d3b026/hubble-dashboard
Farcaster ID: 745222 (sagorahmed)

2. Avail (testnet):
I got rewards for running the node in the Avail testnet. Check here: https://avail.subscan.io/account/5HpZvtSmcmQAkRieHfgq6XJAn5jgvcCRhgar69Z696HCLLrM

3. Sei (Testnet):

4. Story Protocol (testnet):
https://testnet.story.explorers.guru/validator/storyvaloper1u0jw7jnesvqr55fxfmjycm5uxv9w6mjtfzkwdf
My validator node is in the inactive state now.

5. Mantra (testnet):
https://testnet.mantra.explorers.guru/validator/mantravaloper1jervgx2lgmvtg9z2xlct9tg7fy4j459wehw84l

I also ran multiple nodes in the varius networks, such as Allora Network, Nubit, Zetachain, Nibiru, Celestia, etc. but currently I don't have access to them.
Story Network looks promising and has potential to grow to become the number one in this niche. I am learning every day from the crypto space. I believe I can contribute to the Story Network in various ways. I wish I got chosen for the IP token reward so that I can start contributing to the network by running an active validator node.
