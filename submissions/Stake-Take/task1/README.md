# Stake-Take: 

We are **Stake-Take**, a team with over 4 years of experience as validators across various blockchain networks. Our primary focus is on projects within the **Cosmos** ecosystem, where we specialize in supporting and advancing **IBC** (Inter-Blockchain Communication) transactions, ensuring seamless interaction between networks.

## Our Key Focus Areas

- **Validator Experience**:  
  We operate in networks such as **Solana**, **Aleo**, **Stride**, **Umee**, **Ironfish**, and many others. We ensure reliable and secure node operations, actively participate in network governance, and provide RPC, API, and other tools for users.

- **Active IBC Participation**:  
  We specialize in cross-chain transactions within the **Cosmos** ecosystem, deploying and maintaining relayers to facilitate communication between blockchains.

- **Technical Infrastructure**:  
  We place special emphasis on security, utilizing **SSH authentication**, **KMS** for cryptographic key management, and system monitoring through **Grafana** and other tools. Security is our priority, allowing us to maintain a stable infrastructure.

- **Tool Development**:  
  In addition to our validator services, we develop various tools, including **faucets for Archway and Celestia**, node monitoring solutions, and **Telegram bots** for validator activity tracking.

We are actively engaged in supporting communities and projects within the Cosmos ecosystem, offering a full range of services for validators and developers. Learn more about our projects:
