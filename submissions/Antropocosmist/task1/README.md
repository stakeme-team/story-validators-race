# History of the POSTHUMAN validator

The POSTHUMAN validator began its history in 2019, with the validation of the [Cyber](https://cyb.ai/) test network. <br />
Initially, the validator was called Immortal, but after the first jail, it became clear that validator was still far away from immortality, and the Immortal validator was renamed POSTHUMAN. <br />

On January 21, 2021, the POSTHUMAN validator began validating the main network [Starname](https://www.mintscan.io/starname/transactions/1749AB38438428ED84346EFBF488DCB15C1729CAC6B8072EAB4486B36D1D6C9C) <br />
At the moment (September 2023), POSTHUMAN validates 40+ networks, and is one of the leading validators in terms of the number of individual delegators. <br />
The full list of networks is listed [here](https://github.com/Validator-POSTHUMAN/About-POSTHUMAN) <br />

At the moment, the POSTHUMAN validator is under the decentralized governance of the POSTHUMAN delegator community. <br />
Decentralized governance occurs using DAS (Decentralized Autonomous Synchronization), by creating and voting on proposals. <br />
POSTHUMAN delegators can make any decision on the development of the POSTHUMAN validator, as well as change any parameters of the validator in any network. <br />
Information about POSTHUMAN DAS can be found [here](https://medium.com/@antropocosmist/posthuman-das-is-created-578253c8e226) <br />
