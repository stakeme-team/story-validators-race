# Hey, I'm 0xBelnadris 👋

## About Me 
I'm a passionate freelancer and co-founder of Easy Node, a Node as a Service platform. I'm also a solo validator since 2022 with an unwavering commitment to decentralization and security.

## My Mission
I believe in the power of distributed networks and work tirelessly to help them grow and stay secure. That’s why I created Easy Node, to make it easy for people anywhere on Earth (and beyond) to run permissionless nodes in multiple locations in the best possible way.

## Infrastructure
I take pride in my robust and diverse infrastructure setup:
- Servers rented across multiple global locations
- Not dependent on a single provider or location
- Current server locations include:
  - 🇩🇪 Germany
  - 🇺🇸 United States 
  - 🇯🇵 Japan
