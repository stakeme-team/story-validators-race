# My Story

Hello, welcome to Rachel-Testnet-Guides Services, an independent blockchain enthusiast and node operator with almost 4 years of experience in the blockchain space. My journey began out of curiosity, and it has since evolved into a mission to contribute to the integrity and security of decentralized networks. With a strong focus on Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, I dedicate my time to running and managing nodes, ensuring that the networks I participate in are robust, secure, and decentralized.


# My Vision and Mission

My mission goes beyond just validating blocks; I’m actively contributing to the ecosystem by creating accessible, detailed guides that empower individuals to run their own nodes. From mainnets to testnets, my goal is to simplify the complexities of node operations, making it easier for anyone to get involved in the blockchain space. By providing resources that cover setup, security, performance optimization, and troubleshooting, I’m helping the community strengthen decentralized networks, one node at a time.

I operate nodes on reliable, high-performance servers across multiple regions, ensuring uptime and performance are always top-notch. By participating in multiple blockchain networks like Cosmos and Ethereum, I’m contributing to the long-term sustainability and decentralization of these ecosystems.

If you are new to running nodes or want to learn more about setting up and maintaining them, feel free to check out the guides and resources I’ve developed, included:
- Setup Guides: Step-by-step instructions for setting up nodes on various blockchain networks.
- Example Scripts: Scripts to automate common tasks like node setup, monitoring, and maintenance.
- Tools: Utilities and tools to help you manage and optimize your nodes.
- Documentation: In-depth documentation covering node operations, troubleshooting, and best practices.

# My Experience
Currently, I have played an instrumental role in supporting and maintaining the integrity of various blockchain testnet ecosystems. Notably, I have been actively involved in running nodes for the following projects:
- [0gchain](https://explorer.meganode.org/0g/staking/0gvaloper1j8yz49ue8k5vc90tk63hersd2vxrn6ay7aqmma) (One of 125 selected active validators)
- [Hedgeblock](https://explorer.nodestake.org/hedge-testnet/staking/hedgevaloper1crv5du4vch4x4jy5fulekl8fr3yz4s4nf66mq6) (One of 100 selected active validators)
- [Galactica Netwwork](https://testnet.itrocket.net/galactica/staking/galavaloper1kyj2a004k9pysk5xazms7pyp8fya97h37789pp) (One of 100 selected active validators)
- [VOI Netwwork](https://voi-nodes.dev/node/76f57861-b281)
- [Chainbase Network AVS](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/operator/0xf964B97680c5b76c785Ca8baFe115B86C22b271b)
