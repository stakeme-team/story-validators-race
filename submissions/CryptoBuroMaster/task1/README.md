#Introduction:

My name is Rahul, and I'm from Delhi, India. I operate my validator under the name "CryptoBuro," hosted on a European VPS. I have experience running and validating nodes on various blockchain networks, contributing to both Testnets and Mainnets as a validator.

#About My Validator:

My validator is built on high-performance infrastructure, ensuring consistent uptime and network stability. I make sure that my validator remains online 24/7, providing users with reliable and secure transaction validation.

#Networks I Validate On:

1. Story Protocol Testnet
2. Nillion Testnet
3. Chasm Network Testnet

#Recent Contributions:

I have successfully set up a validator node on the Story Protocol Testnet. To help the community, I created a GitHub repository that contains step-by-step instructions on how to set up a node. You can view it here: https://github.com/CryptoBuroMaster/Story-Node/blob/main/README.md.

I am passionate about exploring new technologies and contributing to the decentralization of networks through active participation in the blockchain community.

Thank you,
Rahul
