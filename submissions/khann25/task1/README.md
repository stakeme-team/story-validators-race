## About me

My name is khan6559 from Thailand. I started learning crypto in 2020 and I have a lot of interest in blockchain.
I have some experience Node runner e.g. 0G Avail Nubit Nillion elixir Analog etc. I'm starting to learn how to run a node from youtube and various guilds in the online platform (Twitter,medium etc).
