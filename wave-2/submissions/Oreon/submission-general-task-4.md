Hello, I developed this simple (yet very useful) bash tool some weeks ago to help me manage my node, and i will probably add more functions when i have more time, i have shared it on multiple occasions with the Story node operators.

Can be found on github: https://github.com/alikome/Story-protocol-node-tools

# This tool can:

1 Install Story Node<br>
2 Update Story Consensus<br>
3 Update Story Geth<br>
4 Create validator<br>
5 Get latest block height<br>
6 Get Validator dashboard link<br>
7 Get Validator Public and Private Keys<br>
8 Start the services<br>
9 Restart the services<br>
0 Stop the services<br>
s Apply the latest Snapshot<br>
d Delete node<br>
