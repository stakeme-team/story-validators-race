I edited the description of my validator on the Story Protocol explorer (testnet.storyscan.app).

## Steps Taken:

1. I accessed the Story Protocol explorer at https://testnet.storyscan.app/

2. I searched for my validator using my validator address.

3. I clicked on the "Edit" button next to my validator's information.

4. In the edit form, I updated the following information:
   - Moniker: serve-luctr
   - Details: story protocol best

5. I confirmed the changes and submitted the updated information.

6. I verified that the changes were reflected on the explorer by revisiting my validator's page.

This task allowed me to personalize my validator's information on the Story Protocol explorer, making it more identifiable and showcasing my enthusiasm for the project.
