# RPC and Peers Scanner
We developed a RPC and peers scanner for Story node, so node operators can check for latest working peers and find port exposure risks, especially validators. We also provide active peers list, so you can use to quickly catch up with the chain.

Here is our page: https://decentrio.ventures/tools/rpc-scanner/story

# Snapshots Provder
We also provide both archive and prune snapshots, which are created every 8 hours and 2 latest snapshots are kept. 

You can check our Story snapshots services here: https://decentrio.ventures/services/testnets/story

You can also find our addrbook.json in Addressbook section together with the instructions.
# Endpoints Provider
We provide public endpoint for Story protocol, with rate-limit and load-balance enabled.
