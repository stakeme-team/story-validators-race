## **TTT VN Archive & Pruned Snapshots**

At **TTT Labs**, we prioritize ensuring that validators and operators have access to efficient, fast, and reliable snapshots. Our **Archive and Pruned Snapshots** service plays a critical role in enabling Story blockchain validators to **set up and maintain nodes** quickly, minimize downtime, and ensure smooth participation in the network.

### **Why Archive & Pruned Snapshots Matter**
**Snapshots** are essential for validators who want to save time when setting up nodes or recovering from downtime. Instead of **synchronizing the blockchain from scratch**, validators can use these pre-synced snapshots to start their nodes at a specific block height, ensuring they quickly **sync with the network and participate in consensus**.

**1. Archive Snapshots**  
Archive snapshots contain **complete blockchain data**, ensuring full historical information is available. This is particularly useful for:

-   **Developers** who need to analyze historical transactions.
-   **Auditors** who must validate blocks.
-   Validators who want to retain complete blockchain history.

**2. Pruned Snapshots**  
Pruned snapshots, on the other hand, **trim unnecessary historical data** while keeping the latest state required for node operations. This ensures:

-   **Faster setup times** and reduced storage requirements.
-   More **efficient node performance**, with only essential data maintained.

### **How TTT VN Enhances Snapshot Services**

1.  **Fast Delivery via CDN**  
    We leverage a **global Content Delivery Network (CDN)** to ensure snapshots are delivered **quickly and efficiently**, regardless of the user‚Äôs location. This guarantees minimal delays and ensures validators across the globe can access our snapshots effortlessly.
    
2.  **8-Hour Snapshot Updates**  
    Our snapshots are updated **every 8 hours**, ensuring they remain current and relevant. This high-frequency update cycle minimizes the time validators need to sync with the latest state, ensuring they stay **in step with the network**.
    
3.  **Advanced Monitoring System**  
    TTT VN's snapshot service is supported by an **intelligent monitoring system** that tracks the health and consistency of each snapshot. After every snapshot, our system performs automated checks to ensure:
    

-   **No missing data or corruption** occurs during creation.
-   **Immediate alerts** are issued if any inconsistencies are found.

4.  **High Uptime and Reliability**  
    With robust monitoring and CDN-powered delivery, our snapshot service ensures **maximum uptime**. Validators can trust that **every snapshot is reliable and available** whenever needed.
