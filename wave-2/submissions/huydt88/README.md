## About Me
Hello, I am huydt.  
Discord ID: huydt8947  
As a technology enthusiast, I entered the cryptocurrency market in 2017 after experiencing several setbacks in my initial investments.

I began to realize and delve deeper into node validator operations in 2022, which brought me much joy and passion. 

After many long days immersed in various projects, I have achieved the successes I have today.
