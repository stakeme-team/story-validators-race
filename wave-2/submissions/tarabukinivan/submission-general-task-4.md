  <summary>5) Telegram bot </summary>
The bot monitors the operation of the RPC, the number of peers for Story and Geth.
It checks the Story API. If the API is operational, the command '/storyapiinfo' becomes available, which displays the network height, the total number of validators, the number of active validators, and some network parameters. It compares the node height with the API height. If the node height lags by 300 blocks, it sends a notification to the chat.<br>  
When the proposal comes out, I will add tracking of the proposal and voting from the bot.

Available commands:
 * /status - displays full information about the RPC.
 * /df - displays information about HDD.
 * /free - displays information about RAM.
 * /peers - information about Story and Geth peers.
 * /infoval - validator info
 * /nodeheight - the height of the node.
 * /storyapiinfo - network information from the Story API.
 * /last10blockinfo - information about signing the last 10 blocks.
 * /mute - temporarily disable monitoring, for example during an update or temporarily exit the active set
 * /unmute - enable monitoring
 * /logs - last 30 line log
 * /links - story links
