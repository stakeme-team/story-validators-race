## Task 3: Provide Grafana dashboard
- Develop Grafana dashboard which will contain essential statistics for Story validtor.

There are no strict criteria for this task. The better you develop the Grafana dashboard and better describe the installation guide, the more likely you'll be chosen as the winner. Emphasize metrics, you may have to write your own exporters 

## Submission
To submit your solution, you need to fork this repository. Go to folder `wave-2/submissions`. Then, in the submissions directory, create a folder `your moniker validator`</br>

Create a file `submission-general-task-3.md`</br>
The `submission-general-task-3.md` file should contain description your dashboard and link with template dashboard. A demo link to the dashboard is also provided. A plus would be to provide a guide, on how to install your dashboard.

File structure should look like this:
```bash
wave-2
├── submissions
    └── validator_moniker
        └──submission-general-task-3.md
        └──data.json
```
After that, create a Pull Request (PR). It is important to create the title of such a template:
`General-task-3: <your_moniker> validator submission`

> Apart from submission-general-task-3.md, nothing should be in the PR. Make sure in your PR that you do not make unnecessary changes to the main repository.

## Reward
- 15000 test tokens IP, a total of 10 winners will be selected by the Story team
> The EVM validator address will be taken from your file `data.json` for sending test tokens IP
