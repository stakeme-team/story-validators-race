## Task 1: Automatic installer for the Story node
- Develop one-liner for story node installation, updates, status view and more

There are no strict criteria for this task. The better you develop the script, the better chance you have of being selected as the winner.

## Submission
To submit your solution, you need to fork this repository. Go to folder `wave-2/submissions`. Then, in the submissions directory, create a folder `your moniker validator`</br>
Create a file `submission-general-task-1.md`</br>
The `submission-general-task-1.md` file should contain a guide on how to use your script. Also provide a link to the public repository where your script is located.

File structure should look like this:
```bash
wave-2
├── submissions
    └── validator_moniker
        └──submission-general-task-1.md
        └──data.json
```
After that, create a Pull Request (PR). It is important to create the title of such a template:
`General-task-1: <your_moniker> validator submission`

> Apart from submission-general-task-1.md, nothing should be in the PR. Make sure in your PR that you do not make unnecessary changes to the main repository.

## Reward
- 5000 test tokens IP, a total of 20 winners will be selected by the Story team
> The EVM validator address will be taken from your file `data.json` for sending test tokens IP
