#My validator info
Hello, I'm buray I'm part of the core node team I am involved in marketing and marketing operations in the core node team and as a validator in mainnet and testnet networks I have extensive experience with blockchain technology, having been involved in various projects and roles that have developed my understanding and expertise in this area. Here are some highlights: I have been a node operator in Cosmos and have been involved in many projects, I know how to set up a node and what it takes to be a validator in the network, can build a node and github repo stride and sei network erbie teritori neutron quasar shardeum sui lumoz namada inery mantra with putty and termius can build on network exorde muon network dymension ojo network elys network pactus I have experience from projects babylon tangle network nibiru nulink zeta chain ziesha network gitshock finance 5ire network fleek network kroma network selfchain Avail Exzo network lamina network cascadia Goracle network Cess network Q blockchain Subspace network, humanode mainnet validator, Aligned Layer , Artela Network, Crosfi, Mantra, Og Labs , Ojo Network Avail Router testnet ,Router mainnet Warden Network shardeum Network cosmos and its own chain projects are working right now. As a backup and recovery plan, I back up the information of the projects I set up via winscp, I open a folder on behalf of the project and back up the node information using an external disk, I back up to a separate server for data data, create a folder and back it up. I ensure security by backing up my information to flash memory and external disks, I use servers with high hardware requirements, I create my own user like root for unauthorized access, create a password and block the authority of another user. I back up the nodes with 10 cpu, 60 gb ram, 1 tb ssd server service with putty and mobexterm and in case of any

problem I use a server to set up backup operations and backup data. I prefer Ubuntu based servers. I use Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04.LTS. I can set up my servers according to the version preferred by the projects. I have discord alarm system installed for uptime, I use cosmovisor installation for updates.
