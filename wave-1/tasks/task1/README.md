# Story validators race

## Task 1: Introduce yourself

In the first stage, you need to tell us about yourself and your activity as a validator. Your application should include the following information:

- Information about your validator
- The networks in which you validate
- Recent contributions you have made to blockchain projects


## Submission
To submit your solution, you need to fork this repository. Then, in the submissions directory, create a folder with your GitHub username and add a user.json file with the following content:
> The github_username should be specified from where you forked the repository. This can be your account or organization
```json
{
   "github_username": "string",
   "discord_id": "number",
   "discord_username": "string"
}
```
Next, create a folder named task1 and add a README.md file containing your solution for the first task.

File structure should look like this:
```bash
├── submissions
│   └── github_username
│       ├── task1
│       │   └── README.md
│       └── user.json
```

Once your application is approved, you can proceed to the second task.
