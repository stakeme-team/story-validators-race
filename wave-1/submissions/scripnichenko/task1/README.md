# **Hi, my name is Andrii ‚úåÔ∏è**

I am the founder of [**IT&Science Consulting**](https://www.biznes.gov.pl/en/wyszukiwarka-firm/wpis/ceidg/C4857ECA-BEE9-4DA7-AF01-AADDFC1A684D), a Poland-based IT services firm specializing in innovative and secure technology solutions. My expertise spans across building robust test automation frameworks and performance testing strategies, with a recent focus on Web3 technologies, blockchain infrastructure, and decentralized applications (dApps).

Leveraging my background in DevOps and modern software engineering practices, I help organizations navigate the complexities of Web3 environments. I offer services that ensure reliability, scalability, and security for decentralized networks, with an emphasis on node validation, smart contract testing, and performance optimization.
