## Introduction and Experience:

We position ourselves as an independent node operator by blockchain geeks for blockchain and crypto enthusiasts. We have no VCs or institutional support and indeed care about keeping the stake decentralized. We pride ourselves as a validator supporting networks that create real value. We have been in the staking business since 2019 and run nodes on Ethereum-, Substrate- and Tendermint-based chains. We don't chase after numbers but rather looking for netwoks we will passionately support. We currently run mainnet validators on **Eigen Layer, Automata, Brevis, Mina, Celo, The Graph Protocol, Oasis, Centrifuge, Moonriver & Moonbeam** as well as testnet nodes on **Aligned Layer, Zero Gravity, Olas, Tableland and Diva**.
