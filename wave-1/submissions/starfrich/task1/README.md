# Hello, World! Starfish here.

I am Starfish (or Starfrich), and I’m from Indonesia! Thank you for visiting my profile. I’m passionate about crypto development and have been deeply involved with nodes lately, thanks to my IT background. I enjoy working with CLI and tinkering on my servers almost every day, monitoring activities and planning my next steps.

My first node was on the Dusk Network, followed by Taiko as a proposer, Elixir v1, BEVM, Shardeum, Sonaric, Nillion, Elixir v3, and Story, but all of them were on testnets. I also provide tutorials and automation scripts to help others run specific nodes.

## Network Activities:
1. **Dusk Network** as Validator (Testnet):  
   Validator Address: `0x18282f1fce0bdea495ff92c366c770a2803c71a7`
   
2. **Taiko** as Proposer (Testnet):  
   Proposer Address: `0x87edF3FC62106cE4cdFF2E10a0Ff204Ca45FF3DD`
   
3. **BEVM** as Validator (Testnet):  
   Validator Address: `5T8WCUHaCJPtkw2PrEURtU18kquef8jZNPoiq4yQKZ3AG7p4`  
   *Selected out of 38k applicants.*
   
4. **Nillion** as Verifier (Testnet):  
   Verifier Address: `nillion1d08w3lj8lztywu7kugpw56ufjrrd644zrdnehv`
   
5. **Elixir I & 3** as Validator (Testnet):  
   Validator Address: `0xd97939e5ab6ab7d066a070a1c8d97ee9e769fd28`
   
6. **Shardeum (Sphinx)** as Validator (Testnet):  
   Validator Address: `0x18282f1fce0bdea495ff92c366c770a2803c71a7`
