### Task 1: Introduce Yourself

Hello, my name is Emre, a.k.a ezraike. I have been in the crypto ecosystem since about 2019, after the decline after 2021, I turned to Node / Testnet works. I do not have validator services, faucet / snapshot services like other submission sending friends. In addition to testnets, I voluntarily wrote and translated articles for many projects and published them on my Medium account.

In this process, I participated in the Testnet processes at the initial stage of many well-known projects. These; Aleo Ceremony, Dymension, Kujira, Celestia (Devnet-Testnet-ITN Testnet), Stride, Forta, Lava, Quicksilver etc. 

Among these, the testnet process that contributed the most to me was the Celestia project. In the incentivised testnet process, I installed the Light node, designed an interface that performs PayforBlob transactions on the network through my own node, published it on Github and received extra incentives for it. I will be leaving the relevant links below.

Recently, my focus is on Story Protocol, so in the early days of Testnet, I prepared a guide for the Validator installation in 2 different languages [EN/TR], published it on Github, and provided support to people who had problems during the installation.
