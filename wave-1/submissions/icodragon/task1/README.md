> STAKEME team helps web 3.0 projects to test their product, increase the number of participants in the tesnet, and provide the most efficient development support with dedicated tools. Stakeme are also reliable validator, we provide RPC, snapshots, and useful utilities. We have developed a multichain faucet that is adapted to high loads, and also a self-written explorer. We have extensive experience in developing for various networks, and also have a great community with discord 98k users.

### Our faucet
https://faucetme.pro</br>
Consistently 2k visits per day and the faucet is used by more than 150 people per day.
Improved performance. Thanks to the refactoring the main part of the backend, we speed up the issuance of tokens a few seconds faster. We also use separate RPCs and if one is unacceptable, we will immediately switch to another, that will reduce faucet downtime to a minimum.
Support. The community asks questions about problems with sending a transaction (most often they have problems with RPC), we help to choose the appropriate RPC to successfully interact with the blockchain. We also answer questions related to our faucet.
Low error rate. We analyze our requests and according to our metrics, the failure rate of execution errors is very small, there are practically none.
