Forest Staking, founded in 2021 by former British military Cyber Warfare specialists Gary McNeish and Christopher Dowle, is revolutionizing blockchain validation with a team of ex-military information systems experts and elite Cosmos infrastructure engineers. Built on the foundation of precision, security, and innovation, Forest Staking has rapidly become a powerhouse in the blockchain industry.

We made our mark with the launch of our first validator on the Casper network, quickly forming a strategic partnership with CasperLabs. In just one year, we became the top-performing validator on the Aptos testnet, earning our position as a Genesis validator for the Aptos network, securing over 21 million APT in delegation—a clear testament to our unmatched performance.

Forest Staking has since established key partnerships with some of the leading Layer 1 projects in the blockchain space, including Haqq, Berachain, and Supra Oracles. Our influence and technical superiority have solidified our place as a trusted and highly sought-after validator.

### Security

To safeguard our infrastructure, Forest Staking employs rigorous security measures:

* Traffic restrictions to critical ports only
